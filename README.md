# Budgee ðŸ¦œ

Budgee has been built so that Brendan and Sarah don't have to spend time worrying about their finances.  

The reason I made this is because over the years, I've used many financial apps, tools, websites etc to manage and plan my finances.  None of them worked for me.  

Yes, I could use an Excel spreadsheet.  Buts its 2021!  Yes, I could spend >$50/month on financial software SaaS applications like Xero, MYOB.  But do I really need all the functionality they provide? No.  Does they actually work specifically for me?  No.

It's time to build something that automates my financial life, something that is scalable, something that integrates with all my financial accounts (banks, super, insurance, bills, invesmtent portfolios, crytpo accounts etc).

The goal is to be able to spend more time with my kids, my family, whilst being able to look at a dashboard when I'm walking down the hallway of my house, look at a monitor that is secured to my face, and see that everything is green and in check!

## Features

* Automatic imports of financial transactions
* Customized data modelling for bespoke data sources
* Ability to add account types e.g everyday insurance, mortgage, insurance, superannuation, bills, investments

# Installation

## Firebase Project Creation

We will be using a Firebase project to manage most of the Budgee backend ie database, hosting, functions, storage etc.

### Prerequisites

* Install your preferred editor or IDE.  For Budgee we are using [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/).
* [Sign into Firebase](https://console.firebase.google.com/) using your Google account.

### Step 1: Create a Firebase project

1. In the [Firebase console](https://console.firebase.google.com/), click **Add project**, then select or enter a **Project name**.   Click **Continue**.

### Step 2: Register the Budgee web app with Firebase

TODO

## Firebase Storage Setup

We will be using Firebase storage to store uploaded files and documents into Budgee, as a landing area for subsequent upload on contained data into Firebase Firestore database.  

For example, a monthly bank statement csv may be uploaded to Budgee.  It will land in Firebase Storage in the first instance for futher processing.

### Step 1: Create a default Cloud Storage bucket

1.  From the navigation pane of the [Firebase console](https://console.firebase.google.com/) select **Storage**, then click **Get started**.

    ![](readme_images/2021-06-29-20-47-33.png)

2.  Review the messaging about securing your Cloud Storage data using security rules. For now, we will leave the defaults.  Click **Done**.

3.  Select `australia-southeast1` as the location for your default Cloud Storage bucket.  Click **Done**.

# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `yarn start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `yarn test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `yarn build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `yarn eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you canâ€™t go back!**

If you arenâ€™t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point youâ€™re on your own.

You donâ€™t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldnâ€™t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldnâ€™t be useful if you couldnâ€™t customize it when you are ready for it.
